# Blitzlichtgewitter

Blitzlichtgewitter is a (slow) ray tracer written in Swift.

It loosely follows the steps described in [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/) by Jamis Buck.

## API Design & Coding Style

Same as the project itself, the APIs and the coding style will evolve. It's balanced between the 
[Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) and the aim staying close to the 
Cucumber (Gherkin) scenarios described in [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/).
